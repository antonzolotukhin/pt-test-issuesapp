Voltage is more actual than using capacity which has to be fine tuned to actually work and can handle multiple battery sizes.\r\n\r\nSo the implementation that I am thinking about would be to use the current voltage, the value for the minimum cell voltage and the value of the voltage at startup as maximum since it's always somewhat lower than the maximum cell voltage. I also think some kind of averaging over a small timeframe would be needed to handle fluctuation in voltage and have more consistent display."

    "body": "This PR proposes the introduction of a new method for configuring Rates, based on ideas I've had for quite a long time.  Big THANK YOU to IllusionFPV for providing me with the impetus to actually do something, and for his coding assistance.\r\n\r\nThe classic Betaflight rates model uses three 8 bit parameters:\r\n\r\n- rcRrate, which returns a linear relationship between stick position and rate, such that the maximum rate in deg/s, at full stick, is 200 times the Configurator value (twice the CLI number).\r\n\r\n- SRate, which exponentially increases the preceding linear rate as the sticks move out from centre. It has little or no effect at centre position. The inflexion point of the curve cannot be changed.  Adding more SRate will make for a steeper looking curve because the maximum rate increases a lot at maximum stick deflection.  An SRate value of 0.5 in Configurator (50 in CLI) will double the rate at maximum stick position.\r\n\r\n- Expo, which adds a second 'curve' on top of the preceding values, with greater effect around centre stick position, and no effect on maximum rate.  The inflexion point of the curve is a bit different from the SRate curve, and changes with the amount of expo.  An expo value of 0.5 in Configurator will flatten the rate curve around centre stick by a factor of 2x, but will not change maximum rate.\r\n\r\nWhen we configure our rates, we primarily care about three things:\r\n\r\n- centre stick 'sensitivity', or, how 'twitchy' is the centre stick responsiveness?  Technically, this is determined by the rate change of rate per unit stick deflection around centre position.  \r\n\r\n- the maximum roll rate at full stick deflection, i.e., how fast will it spin when we do a flip.\r\n\r\n- how quickly the responsiveness changes as we move the stick from centre to full deflection, or 'expo inflexion point', meaning, whether the change in responsiveness increases steadily and smoothly as the sticks move further out (low expo, as used by racers), or whether we get a wide range of relatively low responsiveness and then a sudden increase at max rates (high expo, as often used in freestyle).  \r\n\r\nWhile Betaflight rates have been around a long time, the method has some drawbacks:\r\n\r\n- cannot set centre sensitivity or max rate in degrees/s\r\n- each parameter interacts with another in terms of its effect\r\n- limited control over the expo transition point\r\n- weird config numbers that don't directly relate to outcomes\r\n- config numbers that are different in CLI and Configurator\r\n\r\nThis summarises the interactions between Betaflight rate settings and outcomes:\r\n\r\n- centre 'sensitivity' is affected by both rcRate and expo\r\n- max roll rate is affected by both rcRate and SRate\r\n- expo inflexion point is affected by both SRate and expo\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes the eventual replacement of the current Betaflight rates configuration paradigm with a different method.  The goals are:\r\n\r\n- let the user set centre sensitivity, max roll rate and expo inflexion directly\r\n- ensure that value is independent of any other\r\n- set centre sensitivity and max roll rate in deg/s\r\n- ultimately, show the same number in CLI and Configurator (requires 16bit values)\r\n\r\nThe way the code works is:\r\n\r\n- first, use the value for 'centre sensitivity' to directly configure a 'baseline' linear response to stick movement.  The value entered for 'centre sensitivity' represents the actual stick sensitivity at centre in degrees/sec. The number entered is the centre 'feel' you'd get for a linear rate configured at the set deg/s.  This is the kind of 'base' responsiveness.\r\n\r\n- let the user set their desired max turn rate in deg/s, and make a 'wedge shaped' linear ramp of the extra rate amount, above baseline, that is needed to get to that max rate at full deflection.\r\n\r\n- apply an expo factor that changes the inflexion point of that ramped quantity from nearly linear to rising sharply at extreme stick deflection.  \r\n\r\nIdeally, the centre sensitivity and max rate would be entered directly as deg/s.  For example, a freestyle setup might be centre sensitivity of 120 deg/s and max rate of 800 deg/s, and a race setup might range from 150 to 500.  In this PR, I have to re-use the rcRate and Rate 8 bit values.\r\n\r\nTo enter values as per this PR, we have to use 8 bit numbers, as follows:\r\n\r\n- Centre sensitivity: for 150, set rcRate to 1.5 in Configurator,  or 150 in CLI.\r\n- Max Rate: for 800, set SRate to 0.8 in Configurator, or 80 in CLI.\r\n- Expo: set the same as before.  0.5 in Configurator, or 50 in CLI.\r\n\r\nTo determine your current centre sensitivity from the classic Betaflight rates:\r\n\r\n- if you have no expo, it is rcRate * 200\r\n- if you ave expo, it is rcRate * 200, attenuatedby (1-expo). \r\n\r\nSo if you had an rcRate of 0.75 and no expo, your current centre sensitivity is 150.  If you have rcRate of 1.0, and 0.5 of expo, your current centre sensitivity is 100.\r\n\r\nYour max rate is shown by the Rates curve in Configurator.\r\n\r\nOnce you know your current centre sensitivity and max rate, you can switch to the new `ACTUAL` rates method, and enter these values directly.\r\n\r\nThe new expo factor is a true inflexion point curve adjustment, and can't be directly translated from any previous Betaflight settings since they have complex interactions.  A starting value of 0.5 is fairly typical.  When set to 0, the stick responsiveness changes more smoothly than is possible currently.  When set to 1, the expo is quite extreme.  \r\n\r\nNote that changing expo will not change your centre sensitivity or your max rate.  Centre feel will differ with low expo because we get a greater increase in rates around centre than with higher expo, but the actual dead centre sensititity to fine inputs will not change."

    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nOmnibusF4 v2 pro is unable to drive LED strip through dedicated LED connector pin (HW design bug). At the same time, my PPM header is unused. I'd like to use this header to drive my LED strip. After unmapping PPM a PWM 1 resource from PPM header (PB8), mapping LED_STRIP to B8, saving and configuring LED strip, there is no output on PPM pin (checked with oscilloscope). When I try to map LED strip pin to any motor output (and remove motor resource from that pin), LED signal is there. I've also verified physical connection from PPM pin to PB8 on STM32F405RG.\r\n[Schematic of newer version here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b4hq3ikyu77gejm/OmnibusF4-Pro-Sch.pdf).\r\n\r\nIs there something hidden preventing LED_STRIP assignment to PPM(unmapped) pin?\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n - Try to configure LED strip to PPM header (remap resource)\r\n - Nothing on PPM pin (even when you try to remap MOTOR 1 there)\r\n - only constant 0.7V on pin\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n - led strip driving signal appears on PPM pin\r\n\r\n**Flight controller configuration**\r\n```\r\n# diff\r\n\r\n# version\r\n# Betaflight / STM32F405 (S405) 4.1.3 Jan 16 2020 / 11:34:00 (543a5e1ba) MSP API: 1.42\r\n# manufacturer_id: AIRB   board_name: OMNIBUSF4SD   custom defaults: YES\r\n\r\n# start the command batch\r\nbatch start\r\n\r\nboard_name OMNIBUSF4SD\r\nmanufacturer_id AIRB\r\n\r\n# name: ORION\r\n\r\n# resources\r\nresource PPM 1 NONE\r\nresource PWM 1 NONE\r\nresource LED_STRIP 1 B08\r\n\r\n# feature\r\nfeature TELEMETRY\r\nfeature LED_STRIP\r\n\r\n# beacon\r\nbeacon RX_LOST\r\nbeacon RX_SET\r\n\r\n# serial\r\nserial 2 32 115200 57600 0 115200\r\n\r\n# led\r\nled 0 0,0::C:2\r\nled 1 0,1::C:2\r\nled 2 0,2::C:2\r\nled 3 0,3::C:2\r\nled 4 0,4::C:2\r\nled 5 0,5::C:2\r\nled 6 0,6::C:2\r\nled 7 0,7::C:2\r\nled 8 0,8::C:2\r\nled 9 0,9::C:2\r\n\r\n# master\r\nset serialrx_provider = SBUS\r\nset motor_pwm_protocol = DSHOT600\r\nset align_board_yaw = 270\r\nset small_angle = 30\r\nset pid_process_denom = 1\r\nset gyro_1_align_yaw = 2700\r\nset name = ORION\r\n\r\nprofile 0\r\n\r\nrateprofile 0\r\n\r\n# end the command batch\r\nbatch end\r\n```\r\n```\r\n# resource show all\r\nCurrently active IO resource assignments:\r\n(reboot to update)\r\n--------------------\r\nA00: FREE\r\nA01: FREE\r\nA02: MOTOR 4\r\nA03: MOTOR 3\r\nA04: GYRO_CS 1\r\nA05: SPI_SCK 1\r\nA06: SPI_MISO 1\r\nA07: SPI_MOSI 1\r\nA08: FREE\r\nA09: FREE\r\nA10: FREE\r\nA11: USB\r\nA12: USB\r\nA13: FREE\r\nA14: FREE\r\nA15: OSD_CS\r\nB00: MOTOR 1\r\nB01: MOTOR 2\r\nB02: FREE\r\nB03: BARO_CS\r\nB04: BEEPER\r\nB05: LED 1\r\nB06: FREE\r\nB07: SDCARD_DETECT\r\nB08: FREE\r\nB09: FREE\r\nB10: SERIAL_TX 3\r\nB11: FREE\r\nB12: SDCARD_CS\r\nB13: SPI_SCK 2\r\nB14: SPI_MISO 2\r\nB15: SPI_MOSI 2\r\nC00: FREE\r\nC01: ADC_CURR\r\nC02: ADC_BATT\r\nC03: FREE\r\nC04: GYRO_EXTI\r\nC05: FREE\r\nC06: FREE\r\nC07: SERIAL_RX 6\r\nC08: INVERTER 6\r\nC09: INVERTER 3\r\nC10: SPI_SCK 3\r\nC11: SPI_MISO 3\r\nC12: SPI_MOSI 3\r\nC13: FREE\r\nC14: FREE\r\nC15: FREE\r\nD00: FREE\r\nD01: FREE\r\nD02: FREE\r\nD03: FREE\r\nD04: FREE\r\nD05: FREE\r\nD06: FREE\r\nD07: FREE\r\nD08: FREE\r\nD09: FREE\r\nD10: FREE\r\nD11: FREE\r\nD12: FREE\r\nD13: FREE\r\nD14: FREE\r\nD15: FREE\r\nE00: FREE\r\nE01: FREE\r\nE02: FREE\r\nE03: FREE\r\nE04: FREE\r\nE05: FREE\r\nE06: FREE\r\nE07: FREE\r\nE08: FREE\r\nE09: FREE\r\nE10: FREE\r\nE11: FREE\r\nE12: FREE\r\nE13: FREE\r\nE14: FREE\r\nE15: FREE\r\nF00: FREE\r\nF01: FREE\r\nF02: FREE\r\nF03: FREE\r\nF04: FREE\r\nF05: FREE\r\nF06: FREE\r\nF07: FREE\r\nF08: FREE\r\nF09: FREE\r\nF10: FREE\r\nF11: FREE\r\nF12: FREE\r\nF13: FREE\r\nF14: FREE\r\nF15: FREE\r\n\r\nCurrently active Timers:\r\n-----------------------\r\nTIM1: FREE\r\nTIM2:\r\n    CH3: MOTOR 4\r\n    CH4: MOTOR 3\r\nTIM3:\r\n    CH3: MOTOR 1\r\n    CH4: MOTOR 2\r\nTIM4: FREE\r\nTIM5: FREE\r\nTIM6: FREE\r\nTIM7: FREE\r\nTIM8: FREE\r\nTIM9: FREE\r\nTIM10:\r\n    CH1: LED_STRIP\r\nTIM11: FREE\r\nTIM12: FREE\r\nTIM13: FREE\r\nTIM14: FREE\r\n\r\nCurrently active DMA:\r\n--------------------\r\nDMA1 Stream 0: FREE\r\nDMA1 Stream 1: FREE\r\nDMA1 Stream 2: TIMUP 3\r\nDMA1 Stream 3: FREE\r\nDMA1 Stream 4: FREE\r\nDMA1 Stream 5: FREE\r\nDMA1 Stream 6: FREE\r\nDMA1 Stream 7: TIMUP 2\r\nDMA2 Stream 0: FREE\r\nDMA2 Stream 1: FREE\r\nDMA2 Stream 2: FREE\r\nDMA2 Stream 3: ADC 2\r\nDMA2 Stream 4: FREE\r\nDMA2 Stream 5: FREE\r\nDMA2 Stream 6: FREE\r\nDMA2 Stream 7: FREE\r\n```\r\nIt's kinda weird, that B08 shows *FREE* even when LED_STRIP is mapped there.

    "body": "Really not sure if this is a hardware issue or a software fault, so I'm looking for answers everywhere. It's sounding more and more like the latter the longer I look into it.\r\n\r\n**Describe the Bug**\r\nBrand new [Pyrodrone F412 AIO flight controller](https://pyrodrone.com/collections/flight-controllers/products/pyrodrone-aio-412t-fc-esc-aio) refuses to talk to a [Team Blacksheep Unify Pro Nano 5G8 video transmitter](https://pyrodrone.com/collections/vtx/products/tbs-unify-pro-nano-5g8). FC uses Matek F411 as flashing target. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nConnect VTX to TX pad on UART 2. Flash with 4.1.X (none work). Load VTX table for Smart Audio 2.0. Power on quad, notice that VTX Tables page indicates \"no\" device ready, and Smart Audio debug under sensors returns all zeros.\r\n\r\n**Flight Controller Configuration**\r\n- VTX Connected to TX pad on UART 2\r\n- Port 2 is configured for TBS Smart Audio\r\n- FC uses Matek F411 target\r\n- Tried 4.1.3 primarily, but issue persists in 4.1.0 and 4.1.1 as well.\r\n- Loaded with SA version 2.0 VTX table (as specified in TBS manual)\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\n- The VTX works--when I power up, LEDs do turn on on the VTX and I do get a video signal, but Betaflight still doesn't see the VTX.\r\n- I've tried 4.1.0, 4.1.1 and 4.1.3 on both the Matek F411 Legacy and MTKS targets. \r\n- I've tried re-soldering my wire connections.\r\n- The TBS Manual actually says the VTX uses SA 2.0 LITE, but there isn't a VTX table for that, and the manual also states that 2.0 and 2.0 LITE are functionally the same.\r\n-As stated above, SmartAudio debug in blackbox returns all zeros, indicating FC is either receiving no signal from VTX or isn't interpreting signal properly.\r\n-Images below are what I see in my goggles when going through the OSD menu. (Apologies for bad quality, but it's kind of hard to get a good picture of a tiny goggle screen using a large phone.)\r\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60676686/73799946-00e96000-477d-11ea-98a1-18064aeb4ddc.png)\r\n![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60676686/73799951-047ce700-477d-11ea-9893-af18f5ace5b5.png)"

    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nfirst of all, thanks for this great software!\r\nI’m having the following problem, I’m not able to make the current sensing work on my SPRACINGH7EXTREME FC. \r\n\r\nI'm using the following hardware.\r\nFC: SPRACINGH7EXTREME \r\nESC: T-Motor F55A PROⅡ 6S 4IN1 32bit\r\n\r\nThe main battery plug is connected to the ESC and the current sensing output of the ESC is connected to the ADC pad of the flight controller. The resources are set to default (resource ADC_CURR 1 C00)\r\nThe current meter source is set to \"Onboard ADC\". If i plug in the power supply the measured value is 1.18A (power supply shows 0.37A) but if i just keep the USB cable plugged in, the value shows 15.86A.\r\nThe 1.18A value does not change even if the motors are spinning.\r\n\r\nI did the following tests (ESC current sensor unplugged from ADC pad).\r\n1. Plugged in the power supply (15V) and increased the motor speed until the PS showed 1A\r\n-- the voltage of the ESC current sensor output was at 33,4mV\r\n2. increased the motor speed even more until the PS showed 2A\r\n-- the voltage of the ESC current sensor increased to 84,2mV\r\n\r\nI have found the following information on t-motors product page \"Amp monitoring port with the amperage of 15.2mV/A...\", that would not make sense compared to my measurements.\r\n\r\nDid i understand something wrong? Maybe I have to change the resource?\r\n\r\nOne additional thing that i have noticed is that if the PS is plugged in there is a voltage of about 64mV on the ADC pad (current sensor not connected).\r\n\r\nFull dump of my configuration --> https://pastebin.com/5dn25hDR\r\n\r\nThanks for Your help"

    "body": "The current implementation of FPV Camera Angle Compensation does a pretty good job of correcting for the visual perceptual error created by tilting the camera.  It works exceptionally well when the quad is moving forward at EXACTLY the angle specified in the GUI.  \r\n\r\nThe problem, however,  is that the quad is almost never traveling at the exact specified angle set in the GUI.  Pitch is dynamic and therefore the effective compensatory angle is also dynamic.\r\n\r\nA more accurate compensatory angle needs to take into account not only the fixed camera angle but also the pitch of the quad.  \r\n\r\nFor example, when flying a fast quad with very high camera tilt on the race course in a tight, slow section where the quad is moving slower and flying at low pitch (lower than the angle of camera tilt set in the GUI), the quad is essentially over-corrected.  This leads to increased visual perceptual error and makes slower or more technical sections of the race course more difficult to fly.  At higher speeds and higher tilt angles it is not generally a problem.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have found setting the compensatory angle in the GUI at about half or a little less than half of the actual camera angle to give the best results on a race quad, as that seems to be a fairly good average for a flight that requires constantly changing pitch.  But, it could be so much better. \r\n\r\nTHE PROPOSED ENHANCEMENT(S):\r\n1.  Since the flight controller is already monitoring the pitch angle, make the FPV camera compensation angle a dynamic number that takes into account actual pitch.   This would provide the most accurate correction at any pitch angle.\r\n\r\n(fixed camera angle) + or - (actual pitch angle of the quad) = Applied compensation angle\r\n\r\n2.  A simpler but less perfect approach could be to change the compensation angle base on throttle, as throttle and pitch are generally proportional in a forward moving quad.  \r\nLess throttle = less pitch = less compensation.  and vice versa.  I could see this working well within the first 60-70% of the throttle curve (perhaps that could be configurable, too.)\r\n\r\n(FPV Camera Compensation angle) X (throttle %) = Applied compensation angle\r\n\r\nThank you developers for your consideration.  I truly appreciate everything you do.  I hope this will at least lead to a fruitful discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"
